CELLULA – Project Overview (Point Format)
1. Purpose

Digital stem cell donor registry and transplant coordination system

Built for institutional use by the Nepal Stem Cell Research Centre

Aims to reduce transplant delays and manual workload

2. Problems Addressed

Fragmented and offline donor records

Manual request approval processes

No real-time donor availability tracking

Delays in emergency stem cell transplants

Limited coordination between hospitals and registry

3. Solution Provided

Centralized, secure digital platform

Real-time donor database management

Automated matching and notification system

Controlled access for hospitals and administrators

4. User Roles

Admin (Stem Cell Research Centre)

Hospitals / Transplant Units

Registered Stem Cell Donors

5. Key Features

Donor registration and verification

Storage of medical data (blood group, HLA status, age, location)

Hospital request submission system

Admin approval and prioritization

Donor–patient matching logic

SMS / notification alerts to donors

Request status tracking

Role-based access control

6. System Workflow
